legacy drivers for windows (bootcamp but better) 

YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT MAC YOU ARE RUNNING AS I WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DATA LOSS


as it supports newer versions of windows than officially supported (a bit like patching mac os)

DISCLAMERS:
THIS IS ALSO AT THE MOMENT ONLY GOING TO SUPPORT WINDOWS 11 NOT 10 ATM
PREFORMANCE WILLL VARY DEPENDING ON YOUR HARDWARE 
(this is still under development and is comming soon as i am 14 and am not great at coding help would be greatly appreciated)
FIRST RELLESE WILL ONLY REPLACE THE GRAPHICS AND WIFI/BLUTOOTH DRIVERS  TRACKPAD DRIVERS WILL NOT BE SWAPPED
LATER RELESES WILL OPEN THE SUPPORT TO OLDER VERSIONS OF WINDOWS (IF UR A PSYCO)
UPDATES COULD CAUSE ISSUES WITH PATCHES SO DONT UPDATE UNLESS YOU HAVE THE PATCHES FOR THE CURRENT UPDATE OR NEW PATCHES ARE NOT REQIRED
